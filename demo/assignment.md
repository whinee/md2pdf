# TASK 5: INTRODUCTION TO CELL DIVISION

1. What constitutes as a fair portion?

    A fair portion constitutes that of equal portions for everybody involved.

1. What life processes can we apply that concept? Give an example.

    We can apply the concept of equal portions for everybody in cell division.

    The one cell that get the bigger portion will result to a defect, while the one lacking, is obviously lacking and that will also result in a defect on the cell.

    + How does the cell know if it needs to divide?

        Throughout the cell cycle, a cell has multiple monitoring system to determine whether it's time to advance to the next phase, or whether it's time to die and make room for a younger, healthier cell.

        + shit
        + me
        + not

    + How does the cell know when to stop dividing?

        Healthy cells are controlled by growth suppressors, of which one type tells the cell to slow down and stop dividing, while one is responsible for fixing changes in damaged cells.
