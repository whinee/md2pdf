## Summary

While there are no future plans for expanding to the global audience, of which most does not speak English, this application is ready for internationalization.

## Definition of Terms

[i18n](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization#Naming) (abbreviation, [numeronym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeronym)): stands for internationalization; process of designing a software application so that it can be adapted to various languages and regions without engineering changes

## Translation Directory

The files that contain the translations can be located at `./dev/constants/version/{u}/{d}/lang/`

whereas:

- `{u}` refers to the `user` version that uses the constants under this directory
- `{d}` refers to the `dev` version that uses the constants under this directory

## Notes for Translators

For those who want to translate this application, please read all of the following text.

### Rule of Thumb

This is written by the author with no consideration for other languages. And as such, recommendations and suggestions are highly appreciated.

- Any technical terminologies should be left untranslated, unless noted by the author (developer) otherwise.
- Any technical phrase that cannot be translated properly to the target language should be translated without oversimplifying; Oversimplification might lead to a misunderstanding
- Unless the tone affects the meaning of the text or unless stated otherwise, translators should not preserve the author's tone and should translate it with a neutral tone

### Variables

You might see a text that is enclosed in a bracket, like the following:

```txt
{version}
```

These are variables, and are replaced with information in the application before displaying them to the user.

So, our example would be displayed to the users as such:

```txt
69.4.20
```

As you can see, it is crucial for displaying information to the users.

When translating a piece of text, make sure to put these variables in an appropriate place, and do not translate its name.

As an example, we will translate this English text:

```txt
Thank you for using {app_name}!
```

To Tagalog:

<!--- cSpell:disable -->
```txt
Sa paggamit ng {app_name}, ako ay taos-pusong nagpapasalamat sa iyong pagtangkilik!
```
<!--- cSpell:enable -->

The variable's name is not translated.

In this next example, the variable is already in a fixed position:

```txt
{app_name} version: {version}
```

The Tagalog translation should look like this:

<!--- cSpell:disable -->
```txt
bersyon ng {app_name}: {version}
```
<!--- cSpell:enable -->

The `app_name` variable changed places to translate properly. However, there is no need for `version` to do so, as it is formatted.

## Translation File

A translation file can be found under the [translation directory](#translation-directory).

Whereas, its name is ISO 639-1 language code that corresponds to its contained translations.

### Structure

#### metadata

Metadata of the translation.

##### version

Version of the translation.

###### For The Author

Given a version number `major`.`minor`.`patch`, bump the:

- `major` version when you make a significant change in the contents of a text or the description along side it, that you think it warrants a change in all of the translations.

- `minor` version when you make a change in the contents of a text or the description along side it, which does not warrant a change in all of the translations. Example are modifying text to use much more understandable words.

- `patch` version when you fix a typographical error in a text. This might induce a change in other translation, but does not warrant otherwise.

Changing the schema, or any key names shall warrant a `dev` version bump for the application. You break the english text for this application, you fix every other translation.

###### For The Translators

As the app is written in English, follow the latest version of the english text.

The translation will be bumped as per the specification written [here](#translation-file-structure-metadata-version-for-the-author).

If you updated your translations to match that of the current English translation, change the version to the current version of the English translation.

##### contributors

Dictionary of scopes, classes, and keys (dictionary) of text to display in the application.

##### {scope}

###### {class}

This is where keys are categorized. For example, keys that convey information regarding the application can be put under the `info` class, while the keys that are used for prompting the users can be put under the `prompt` class.

####### {key}

######## tln

Stands for translators' notes, used by translators to describe to the next translators any compromises done to translate the text to a certain language, or whatnot.
