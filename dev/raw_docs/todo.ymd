### Tags

- **feat**: Feature
    - ***md***: Markdown Syntax/Feature Extension
    - ***gui***: Graphical User Interface
- **dev**: Developer Tools

## Todo

- [ ] [feat:md] n-column support
- [ ] [feat:gui] GUI
- [ ] [feat:md] Custom Help Function (to only compute help page's width when help is actually called; the CLI is actually already fast enough that this might not be necessary, but is just a mere novelty)
- [ ] [dev] Update powershell scripts to be up-to-date with the bash scripts

## In Progress

- [ ] [feat:md] Custom mermaid.js renderer (will be done after the GUI, as the HUI will be written in JS, and the rendered will be using JS too)

## Done

- [x] [feat:md] Custom KaTex renderer (as the best one for Weasyprint use, [mbarkhau/markdown-katex](https://github.com/mbarkhau/markdown-katex) is so dang slow)
