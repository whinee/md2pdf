          If you have managed to install this program, but is not able to make this work, I apologize for the enormous effort you have made to make it through to this part. However, it seems that it is not enough. As a Linux user, I would not be able to help, nor would I want to even if I have the ability to do so. Windows has traumatized me to the point of despair, extreme paranoia, and mania. I do not wish for Windows to touch me ever again. Thank you for attempting to use this program, but it seems that this is our farewell. I wish you nothing but the best, kind stranger.

          If you have managed to install this program, but is not able to make this work, I apologize for the enormous effort you have made to make it through to this part. As a poor Linux user rocking an 11-year old thinkpad, I do not have access to any Mac machines that I can test this program in, along with problems that might come in the way. Thank you for attempting to use this program, but it seems that this is our farewell. I wish you nothing but the best, kind stranger.
