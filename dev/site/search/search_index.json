Getting Started Visit this link to get started. The instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. Advantages Standardized Styles Consistent Results Programmatic Usage Disadvantages This program does not guarantee that you will be able to write faster, just be able to write in markdown (effectively plaintext) and produce consistent results (assuming that you use the same text, settings, stylesheet/s, and whatnot) Have to link pictures online in order to attach one in the document, unlike in fancy word editors like Microsoft Word or LibreOffice Writer Translations This program is translation ( i18n ) ready! Please refer to this link to learn more on how to create a translation for this program. Known Issues and Limitations This program can not be run in termux due to an inherent bug in AOSP that the said org's developers refuses to fix even if it will only take (apparently) a change in a single line of code (I forgot where the relevant Stackoverflow link is stored at, nor do I know the keywords for searching it up) Considerations I want to implement more features as to extend the markdown specification, and in this link , you can see the following considerations to be made for future feature implementations.

This is as the Commonmark Markdown specification does not support such feature. However, there is a simple problem with tables in markdown: it does not support multi-line cells Time and time again, I have searched for ways to be able to write multi-line cells in a kind of markdown way. All of them are ugly implementations. None of them can satisfy me. And then I came across MultiMarkdown's table documentation which makes an interesting observation: If you need complex tables you will need to create them by hand or with a tool specifically designed for your output format. At some point, however, you should consider whether a table is really the best approach if you find MultiMarkdown tables too limiting. And I think that that is true. However, I have thought of a solution. That is to parse markdown inside HTML tags. Such as that the following markdown... < table > < tr > < th > Header </ th > </ tr > < tr > < td > - Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet - Consectetur adipiscing elit - Integer molestie lorem at massa </ td > </ tr > </ table > ...will be converted to HTML like the following: < table > < tr > < th > Header </ th > </ tr > < tr > < td > < ul > < li > Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet </ li > < li > Consectetur adipiscing elit </ li > < li > Integer molestie lorem at massa </ li > </ ul > </ td > </ tr > </ table > But, I think that the best solution would be to just make my own implementation of columns. A solution I am considering at the time of writing is using a custom HTML tag called cols (stands for columns) that wraps col (stands for column) tags, which in turn wraps content in a column. Such as that the following markdown leads to 3 columns. < cols > < col > Column #1 </ col > < col > Column #2 </ col > < col > Column #3 </ col > </ cols > And yes, the content inside each col tags will be interpreted as markdown. Tables Despite the talk about the tables above, there is still a legitimate reason to use multi-line tables, such as shitty homeworks that requires such. And more often than not, these tables are multi-line. And as such, I have thought to actually implement interpreting content inside table cells as markdown, as discussed above. The rationale for this is that while it strays from the actual purpose of using HTML inside of markdown, this can ease up using multi-line tables. And yes, an option to turn this shitty feature off. I hate that I have to do these because of school works. No, this is the point of this whole damn thing: to make writing my home works more efficient. But I hate going to school. I barely have time to talk to my girlfriend. But what am I saying right here? Considering that nobody will be able to read this far in this nest of documentation, I doubt that someone will see this. But I digress. CSS I have a really grand plan: to parameterize common CSS rulesets. GUI I do not have proper plans for the GUI of this project yet. But boredom does wonders. I was once subjected to the horrors of national achievement test and mock exams for 4 days. And we are not allowed to use our phones for 4-5 hours straight a day, for 4 days. And so, I scribbled to a scratch paper that I had. And what do you know, I have this graph.

Now, why have not I put the implement features under this header? As it will break the link to other documents. Page Breaks Implemented in 0.0 There is no plain markdown way to add pagebreak in a markdown file. However, I came across this stackoverflow answer that mentions that the answer-er uses <<<<>>>> to denote pagebreak in their documents. And I liked that!

Reporting Bugs Before Submitting a Bug Report A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible. Make sure that you are using the latest version. Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side e.g. using incompatible environment components/versions (Make sure that you have read the Latest Documentation (0.0.x.x) . If you are looking for support, you might want to check this section ). To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the same issue you are having, check if there is not already a bug report existing for your bug or error in the bug tracker . Also make sure to search the internet (including Stack Overflow) to see if users outside of the GitHub community have discussed the issue. Collect information about the bug Stack trace (Traceback) OS, Platform and Version (Windows, Linux, macOS, x86, ARM) Version of the interpreter, compiler, SDK, runtime environment, package manager, depending on what seems relevant. Possibly your input and the output Can you reliably reproduce the issue? And can you also reproduce it with older versions? How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report? You must never report security related issues, vulnerabilities or bugs including sensitive information to the issue tracker, or elsewhere in public. Instead sensitive bugs must be sent by email to <>. We use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project: Open an Issue . (Since we can't be sure at this point whether it is a bug or not, we ask you not to talk about a bug yet and not to label the issue.) Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior. Please provide as much context as possible and describe the reproduction steps that someone else can follow to recreate the issue on their own. This usually includes your code. For good bug reports you should isolate the problem and create a reduced test case. Provide the information you collected in the previous section. Once it's filed: The project team will label the issue accordingly. A team member will try to reproduce the issue with your provided steps. If there are no reproduction steps or no obvious way to reproduce the issue, the team will ask you for those steps and mark the issue as needs-repro . Bugs with the needs-repro tag will not be addressed until they are reproduced. If the team is able to reproduce the issue, it will be marked needs-fix , as well as possibly other tags (such as critical ), and the issue will be left to be implemented by someone . Suggesting Enhancements This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for md2pdf, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality . Following these guidelines will help maintainers and the community to understand your suggestion and find related suggestions. Before Submitting an Enhancement Make sure that you are using the latest version. Read the Latest Documentation (0.0.x.x) carefully and find out if the functionality is already covered, maybe by an individual configuration. Perform a search to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one. Find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to you to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Keep in mind that we want features that will be useful to the majority of our users and not just a small subset. If you're just targeting a minority of users, consider writing an add-on/plugin library. How Do I Submit a Good Enhancement Suggestion? Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub issues . Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the suggestion. Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement in as many details as possible. Describe the current behavior and explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why. At this point you can also tell which alternatives do not work for you. You may want to include screenshots and animated GIFs which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part which the suggestion is related to. You can use this tool to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and this tool or this tool on Linux. Explain why this enhancement would be useful to most md2pdf users. You may also want to point out the other projects that solved it better and which could serve as inspiration. Your First Code Contribution Improving The Documentation Submitting a Pull Request This is based on Michael Herrmann 's gist titled Good PRs are minimal . Every Pull Request (hereinafter referred to as PR) should have one, and only one, unique goal. The PR should make the absolute minimum number of changes that are required to achieve this goal. The fewer things you change, the easier it will be for the team to see what you did, and thus gain confidence that you PR makes sense. Dont\u2019s Changing whitespace unnecessarily, eg. switching tabs and spaces. This leads to huge numbers of unnecessarily changed lines of code. Running a linter not listed in the linters currently used by the project Don't unnecessarily introduce new tools or dependencies. I'm sure you have your favorites. But don't force them on me or other contributors. Stick to those that are absolutely required, or come with the language. Obey the same code style as the library: Tabs or spaces, maximum line length, etc. In short: Good PRs are minimal. You're very welcome to add several improvements.

Basically, I do not know, I just want to get it out of my chest. Table of Contents KaTeX Support KaTeX Support For this project, I planned it to ship with a KaTeX support. I have only found a single python-markdown extension that is also compatible with Weasyprint, and that is markdown-katex by mbarkhau . However, it is so dang slow. From my testing, it takes about 200 seconds (or roughly over 3 mins) to convert a markdown file with around 5-10 formulae in it to a 200 kb PDF file, which is about a kbps. However, that is a shitty metric, as there is an image in there, but you get the point, It is slow as fuck. Now, what I did is attempt to rewrite mbarkhau 's implementation of KaTeX for python-markdown. Built it from the ground up, taking motivation from the original project and some other extensions along the way. Heavily rebuilding the logic behind the things that I figured out takes up most of the time. I narrowed it down to two things that slows it down the most: the preprocessor and postprocessor functions. I figured out that the iterator for feeding KaTeX formulae into the KaTeX binary took the longest as the process persists for quite a while on my machine's process monitoring tool. And as such, I made that process multithreaded. Weeks after almost achieving feature-parity with the original project, I encountered an error. It was not of my program, but of the python-markdown's. And as such, I dug up the code that caused that error and extracted that to my program to be able to modify the code and remove the snippet that causes the error in the first place. And of course, that affected the rendering process. There's no more hope. I did something wrong, and I can not track down where it went wrong. Then, it finally hit me. The problem is when I attempted to rebuild the already perfect python-markdown KaTeX implementation. I just need to make it multithreaded. And while I still need to extract the stuff to make it work with the other stuff that I plan to add, I still only need to modify about 20% of the original project. I am so fucking dumb. Or so I thought, two weeks later, after doing just that, it's still slow. And what I mean by slow is that I can run the program, wash the plate I used for eating the leftover cake for like about a minute or two, make myself a cup of coffee, and come back to that damn thing still running! Luckily, I narrowed it down to the very root cause of it all: the logic that searches for the KaTeX binary in the machine. I do not know how or why the heck is it so slow. In any case, I replaced it with a shutil's implementation of which , modified to work with the extension. And fortunately, it worked! The logic still looks the same as the old one, but the damn thing runs from 30 secs down to sub-five seconds, depending where the binary is at. Like, whaaaaaat?!?! What is the moral of the story then? That someone's code might actually be the best solution for the problem. But if it does not work, then do not try to rebuild it from the ground up. See first if you can modify some parts of it to work with your problem. Then if it does not work, then proceed to rebuilding it. As often times, that solution might be the best solution for that exact problem, but not for your own, exact problem. Or is that it? Maybe I just wanted to rant about the stupid weeks I have wasted for this little thing to fucking work? Or is it because I just wanted to flex how much I have optimized a single thing? I do not fucking know, but I sure did flex'd to my friends about how I \"optimized\" a program to run 40x faster. I mean, where is the lie? Now, where am I again? Oh, right, KaTeX support.

DOs Use lowercase letters for variable and function names, and separate words with underscores (_). Use uppercase letters for constant variables, and separate words with underscores (_). Use CamelCase notation for naming classes. Prefix private variables and functions with a single underscore (_), and use double underscores (__) for name mangling. DON\u2019Ts Avoid using single-character variable names except for counters and iterators. Avoid using names that have special meaning in Python, such as \"list\" or \"str\". Versioning System Look, you have made your own versioning system based off semver 2.0.0. Use it properly. Given a version number user . dev . minor . patch , increment the: user version when you make any changes to the user interface/experience. Hereunder are exceptions for user experience changes that invokes a user version bump: Performance gains (that might improve ) dev version when you make incompatible API changes, minor version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and patch version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes. If in doubt, please DO visit semver.org . Version Bump Guides ANY change in the user interface/experience SHALL induce a user version bump. ANY change in the schema shall induce a dev version bump.

See prompt_toolkit.layout.formatted_text for more information. (It's mostly optimized for rather small widgets, like toolbars, menus, etc...) When this UI control has the focus, the cursor will be shown in the upper left corner of this control by default. There are two ways for specifying the cursor position: Pass a get_cursor_position function which returns a Point instance with the current cursor position. If the (formatted) text is passed as a list of (style, text) tuples and there is one that looks like ('[SetCursorPosition]', '') , then this will specify the cursor position. Mouse support: The list of fragments can also contain tuples of three items, looking like: (style_str, text, handler). When mouse support is enabled and the user clicks on this fragment, then the given handler is called. That handler should accept two inputs: (Application, MouseEvent) and it should either handle the event or return `NotImplemented` in case we want the containing Window to handle this event. :param focusable: bool or :class: .Filter : Tell whether this control is focusable. :param text: Text or formatted text to be displayed. :param style: Style string applied to the content. (If you want to style the whole :class: ~prompt_toolkit.layout.Window , pass the style to the :class: ~prompt_toolkit.layout.Window instead.) :param key_bindings: a :class: .KeyBindings object. :param get_cursor_position: A callable that returns the cursor position as a Point instance.

Definition of Terms i18n (abbreviation, numeronym ): stands for internationalization; process of designing a software application so that it can be adapted to various languages and regions without engineering changes Translation Directory The files that contain the translations can be located at ./dev/constants/version/{u}/{d}/lang/ whereas: {u} refers to the user version that uses the constants under this directory {d} refers to the dev version that uses the constants under this directory Notes: For more information, visit the notes for whi~nyaan! . Notes for Translators For those who want to translate this application, please read all of the following text. Rule of Thumb This is written by the author with no consideration for other languages. And as such, recommendations and suggestions are highly appreciated. Any technical terminologies should be left untranslated, unless noted by the author (developer) otherwise. Any technical phrase that cannot be translated properly to the target language should be translated without oversimplifying; Oversimplification might lead to a misunderstanding Unless the tone affects the meaning of the text or unless stated otherwise, translators should not preserve the author's tone and should translate it with a neutral tone Variables You might see a text that is enclosed in a bracket, like the following: {version} These are variables, and are replaced with information in the application before displaying them to the user. So, our example would be displayed to the users as such: 69.4.20 As you can see, it is crucial for displaying information to the users. When translating a piece of text, make sure to put these variables in an appropriate place, and do not translate its name. As an example, we will translate this English text: Thank you for using {app_name}! To Tagalog: Sa paggamit ng {app_name}, ako ay taos-pusong nagpapasalamat sa iyong pagtangkilik! The variable's name is not translated. In this next example, the variable is already in a fixed position: {app_name} version: {version} The Tagalog translation should look like this: bersyon ng {app_name}: {version} The app_name variable changed places to translate properly. However, there is no need for version to do so, as it is formatted. Translation File A translation file can be found under the translation directory . Whereas, its name is ISO 639-1 language code that corresponds to its contained translations. Structure metadata Metadata of the translation. version Version of the translation. For The Author Given a version number major . minor . patch , bump the: major version when you make a significant change in the contents of a text or the description along side it, that you think it warrants a change in all of the translations. minor version when you make a change in the contents of a text or the description along side it, which does not warrant a change in all of the translations. Example are modifying text to use much more understandable words. patch version when you fix a typographical error in a text. This might induce a change in other translation, but does not warrant otherwise. Changing the schema, or any key names shall warrant a dev version bump for the application. You break the english text for this application, you fix every other translation. For The Translators As the app is written in English, follow the latest version of the english text. The translation will be bumped as per the specification written here . If you updated your translations to match that of the current English translation, change the version to the current version of the English translation. contributors List of translation contributors' information, for attribution purposes. name Name of the contributor.

Example: music_artist_rec: str: Listen to Kanro! https://kanromusic.com desc: Author's music artist recommendation str The actual splash message. desc Description of the splash message. Might be useful to keep the translation accurate at an acceptable margin. Will not be displayed. tln Stands for translators' notes, used by translators to describe to the next translators any compromises done to translate the text to a certain language, or whatnot. text Dictionary of scopes, classes, and keys (dictionary) of text to display in the application. Example: cli: init: choose_language: str: Choose language desc: |- Choose app language {scope} There are three scopes allowed, but only the first two are applicable: common cli gui The first scope is class of keys that can be used in both the CLI and GUI versions of the app. This includes the description and motto of the program, prompts like yes or no , and whatnot. The rest is self-explanatory. {class} This is where keys are categorized. For example, keys that convey information regarding the application can be put under the info class, while the keys that are used for prompting the users can be put under the prompt class. {key} This is the name of the key. There is no general naming convention, but the developer seems to have one in her mind. str The string in the language defined by the language file. desc Description of the key. Might be useful to keep the translation accurate at an acceptable margin. Will not be displayed. tln Stands for translators' notes, used by translators to describe to the next translators any compromises done to translate the text to a certain language, or whatnot.","title":"Translations"}]}
