## **Summary**

<!-- cspell: disable-next-line -->
Yet 'nother fucking oopsies...

## **Changes**

### **Added**

- `docs/now.md` for what {{author}} is doing after or during the latest commit
- `no_implicit_optional` and `ruff` as dev requirements

### **Changed**

- `.gitattributes` for more accurate language stats
- `dev/scripts/py/docs.py` so that markdown files with no lower than h4 should not be subjected to the horrible workaround of styling headers just to support 'til "h11" ???
